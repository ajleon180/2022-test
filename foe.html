			<h2 class="foetext">Invasive Species</h2>
			<p>Due to their resilience, ability to grow almost anywhere, and the
			speed at which they spread and grow, dandelions are considered by many to
			be a weed. Dandelions are often found in places where they were not
			intentionally planted, including lawns, landscaped planters, and gaps in
			pavement.</p>
